        <p className="mb-3">
            Ever since a young age I have been fascinated with everything tech. It started with messing about with computers and now to building full fledged apps. I graduated in June 2021 with a degree in Computer Engineering and developed a strong interest in providing solutions to problems. Throughout my University and career I have built projects which involve deep learning, SaaS, AWS, Restful APIs, Springboot, React and much more. I am currently looking for full-time junior opportunities in Software Development, Business Analytics or Product Management. When I am not working or building projects, I like to play and watch football (Real Madrid fan btw). I am also an active gamer of AAA titles and I also occasionally play guitar as well.

        <p className="mb-3 ">
            Ever since a young age, I have been fascinated with everything tech. It started with messing about with computers and now to building full fledged apps. I graduated in June 2021 with a degree in <span className="font-medium">Computer Engineering</span> and developed a strong interest in providing solutions to problems. Throughout my University and career, I have built projects that involve <span className="italic">Deep learning, SaaS, AWS, Restful APIs, Springboot, React</span> and much <span className="font-medium">more</span>.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
            I am currently looking for full-time <span className="font-medium">Junior</span> opportunities in <span className="font-medium">Software Development</span> or <span className="font-medium">Product Management</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am <span className="italic">not working</span> or building projects, I like to play and watch football (Real Madrid fan btw). I am also an active gamer of AAA titles and I also occasionally play guitar as well.
